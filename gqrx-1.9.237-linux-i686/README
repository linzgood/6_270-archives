Gqrx is an experimental AM, FM and SSB software defined receiver implemented using
GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit.

Currently it works on Linux and can use the Funcube Dongle as input source.

Dependencies:
  - gnuradio-core 3.4.0 or later
  - gnuradio-audio 3.4.0 or later
  - gr-fcd (https://github.com/csete/gr-fcd)
  - Qt 4.7 (available in all recent Linux)

You can download gqrx either as a source package or binary package from TBD website.

The binary packages avaialble for 32 and 64 bit Linux include the necessary GNU Radio
and FCD packages, but you still need to install their dependencies:
  - libfftw3
  - libgsl 1.14
  - Boost 1.42 or later (thread, datetime, system, filesystem)
  - libusb-1.0
  - libasound2

Something might be missing from the above list. A complete list of dependencies is
available at http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/BuildGuide
see the section called "Operating System Specific Instructions".

If you choose to build gqrx from source you will have to build and install GNU Radio
and gr-fcd yourself.

The build system is based on qmake and to build gqrx simply load the gqrx.pro file
into Qt Creator and click build (the hammer icon).

If the GNU Radio libraries have been installed into a non-standard location, e.g.
/opt/gnuradio, Qt Creator may not be able to pick up the headers and libraries.
Assuming that your PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set up correctly, you can work around this
by launching Qt Creator from the terminal.


Whether you build gqrx from source or use the binary packages, you have to configure
the FCD to be usable by non-root users. If you can already run qthid as regular user
it is fine. If not, you need to create a udev rule. Create a udev file
/etc/udev/rules.d/20-fcd.rules containing:

 SUBSYSTEMS=="usb" ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8" ATTRS{idProduct}=="fb56" MODE:="0666" SYMLINK+="FCD"

(hint: open a terminal and type: sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/20-fcd.rules)

Reload the rules using "sudo udevadm control --reload-rules". You can the verify the setup
using qthid http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/funcube-dongle/qthid-fcd-controller


First time you start gqrx it will ask you to specify the input and output device.
For the input device you can check /proc/asound/cards to see what number the
Funcube Dongle has. For example:

 0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel
                      HDA Intel at 0xf0120000 irq 49
 1 [HDMI           ]: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI HDMI
                      HDA ATI HDMI at 0xf0210000 irq 50
 2 [default        ]: USB-Audio - FUNcube Dongle V1.0
                      Hanlincrest Ltd.          FUNcube Dongle V1.0   at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1.7

means that you can use hw:2 as input device.

Technically, gqrx can use any soundcard as input device but the sample rate is fixed
at 96 kHz (bug).
